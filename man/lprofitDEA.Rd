\title{Linear profit DEA model}
\usage{
lprofitDEA(X, Y, pX, pY, RTS = "vrs")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix or dataframe with DMUS as rows and inputs as columns}

\item{Y}{Matrix or dataframe with DMUs as rows and outputs as columns}

\item{pX}{Matrix or dataframe with prices for each DMU and input.
Therefore it mus have the same dimensions as X.}

\item{pY}{Matrix or dataframe with prices for each DMU and output.
Therefore it mus have the same dimensions as Y.}

\item{RTS}{Character string indicating the returns-to-scale, e.g. "crs", "vrs"}
}
\value{
A list object containing optimal inputs and outputs, lambdas for the 
peers of optimal allocation and efficiency scores as the ratio of the differences
between the observed and optimal difference of cost to revenue.
}
\description{
Linear profit DEA model optimizing the difference of cost to revenue.
It returns the estimated lambdas as well as the optimal values for inputs and outputs.
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(c(1,2,3,3,2,1,2,2), ncol = 2)
Y <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1), ncol = 1)

pX <- matrix(c(2,1,2,1,2,1,1,2), ncol =  2, byrow = TRUE)
pY <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1), ncol = 1)
