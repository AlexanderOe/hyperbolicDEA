\arguments{
\item{X}{Matrix or dataframe with DMUS as rows and inputs as columns}

\item{Y}{Matrix or dataframe with DMUs as rows and outputs as columns}

\item{RTS}{Character string indicating the returns-to-scale, e.g. "crs", "vrs", "ndrs", "nirs", "fdh"}

\item{WR}{Matrix with one row per homogeneous linear weight restriction in standard form, ncol(WR) = ncol(X) + ncol(Y)}

\item{SLACK}{Variable indicating whether an additional estimation of slacks shall be performed}

\item{ACCURACY}{Accuracy value for non-linear programmer}

\item{XREF}{Matrix or dataframe with firms defining the technology as rows and inputs as columns}

\item{YREF}{Matrix or dataframe with firms defining the technology as rows and outputs as columns}

\item{SUPEREFF}{Variable indicating whether superefficiencies shall be estimated}

\item{NONDISC_IN}{Vector containing indices of the input matrix that are non-discretionary variables}

\item{NONDISC_OUT}{Vector containing indices of the output matrix that are non-discretionary variables}

\item{PARALLEL}{Integer of amount of cores that should be used for estimation (Check availability of computer)}

\item{ALPHA}{ALPHA can be chosen between [0,1]. It indicates the relative weights given to the distance function to
both outputs and inputs when approaching the frontier. More weight on the input orientation is set by alpha < 0.5. Here,
the input efficiency score is estimated in the package. To receive the corresponding output efficiency score, estimate: e^((1-alpha)/alpha).
Vice versa for an output weighted model alpha > 0.5. The output efficiency is given and the input efficiency can
be recovered with: e^(alpha/(1-alpha))}
}
\value{
A list object containing efficiency scores, lambdas, and potentially slacks and
binding parameters in the weight restrictions (mus)
}
\description{
Hyperbolic DEA implementation including weight restrictions,
non-discretionary variables, gerenralized distance function, external referencing, estimation of slacks and
superefficiency scores. The mathematical and theoretical foundations of the code are presented in the paper
"Data Envelopment Analysis and Hyperbolic Efficiency Measures: Extending Applications and Possiblities
for Between-Group Comparisons" (2023) by Alexander Ã–ttl, Mette Asmild, and Daniel Gulde.
