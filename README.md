# hyperbolicDEA R-package

Hyperbolic DEA implementation including weight restrictions, non-discretionary variables, gerenralized distance function, external referencing, estimation of slacks and superefficiency scores. The mathematical and theoretical foundations of the code are presented in the paper "Data Envelopment Analysis and Hyperbolic Efficiency Measures: Extending Applications and Possiblities for Between-Group Comparisons" (2023) by Alexander Ã–ttl, Mette Asmild, and Daniel Gulde.
